# odin-recipes

This is my first public project on git hub. I am learning with the help and content of "The Odin Project" using VS Code.

In this project I will be utilizing the skills I have learn so far within The Odin Project. These skills consist primarly within the language of HTML and to build my first HTML chops. 
The website will look very basic but later will revisit this project in the future for some CSS styling. 

Some of the skills that will be used in this project as of now are:

Initial Structure

1. Creating a local respository and linking it to github.
2. Creating an index.html file.
3. Adding a HTML Boilerplate, body and heading within the index.html file.

Pages

1. Creating a a new directory inside of the odin-recipe repository and give it new name "recipes" 

2. Within this new recipes directory create HTML files for the recipes. 

3. Addingthe following to each of these files created.

    * HTML Boilerplate
    * Title
    * Headings 
    * body

4. Within the index.html create a link to the recipe page.
    - Making sure to include the coding to allow page to open in a new tab. This is to form good habit and coding practice.

5. Within the recipe.html create a link back to the index.html file for easier nagivation which placement of this link at the bottom of the page.

Content

This new recipe page should have the following content.

    1. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading.

    2. Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

    3. Under the description, “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

    4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

Additional Pages

    - Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.

    - Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.


Practices

Ensuring to save and commit often with good concise commits. Also to double check for grammar errors.
